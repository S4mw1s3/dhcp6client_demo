This is a simple demo application to test the picotcp dhcpv6 client implementation.

Run create_vde.sh to setup your environment (configure VDE interface, set ipv6
address to VDE interface and bind DHCPv6 server).

Once this is done, make sure that picotcp is set to the correct path in the Makefile.

To compile and execute:

$ make
$ ./app
$ ping6 2001:db8:0:1::xxxx
